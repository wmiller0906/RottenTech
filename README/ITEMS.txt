Items serve a core function in this game. They are used for:
- Combat against NPCS
- Trading with NPCS
- Consuming for benefits
- Navigating the world through unlocking areas
- Crafting to build other items
The following content below is a breakdown of how items work.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

UNIVERSAL ITEM TRAITS
- ID (int)
    Items all have an unique ID consisting of 5 digits
    The first digit signifies the item type
    The second digit signifies a further break down
    Digits 3-5 are unique to the item
    If no further break down, then the second digit is 0
    The following is a list of item classifer IDs:
        1xxxx: Weapons
            11xxx: Guns
            12xxx: Melee
            13xxx: Throwables
        2xxxx: Attire
            21xxx: Armor
            22xxx: Clothing
        3xxxx: Consumables
            31xxx: Food
            32xxx: Medical Aid
            33xxx: Drugs
            34xxx: Traps
        4xxxx: Equipment
        5xxxx: Ammo
        6xxxx: Junk
        7xxxx: Quest Items
        8xxxx-9xxxx: TBD
- WEIGHT (double)
    Items have a weight. The inventory system allows the player to carry up to this limit.
    Only the player is affected by the weight limit as NPCs will only interact with the items they spawn with.
- VALUE (int)
    Items have a base value for their worth when trading.
    This base value serves as a reference to the real value adjusted based on circumstances.
        Perks affecting trade => May +% increase value for selling or -% decrease for buying
        Merchants will buy goods from player for less than true value due to "needing a profit"
- NAME (string)
    Pretty self-explanatory
