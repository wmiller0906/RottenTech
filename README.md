# TechRot

**RottenTech** is a personal C++ game development project designed to simulate survival in a cyberpunk environment. It includes core mechanics for managing items, weapons, and character interactions in a structured, object-oriented way.
This is still in the early phases of development so it will continue to be fleshed out.

## Features

- Modular class-based architecture using C++
- Weapons and armor implemented with reusable `Item` inheritance
- Flexible weapon definitions using `GunData` (data-driven design)
- Header/source organization for scalability
- Makefile-based build system with support for debug/release switching

---

## Goals

- Practice clean C++ design and file structure
- Build a foundation for future gameplay, combat, or RPG mechanics
- Become proficient in using Git to work on code

---

## Technologies Used

- C++
- GNU Make
- Git/GitHub
- AWS Cloud9 IDE
